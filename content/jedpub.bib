 abstract = {We consider multiphysics applications from algorithmic and
architectural perspectives, where ``algorithmic'' includes both
mathematical analysis and computational complexity and
``architectural'' includes both software and hardware environments.
Many diverse multiphysics applications can be reduced, en route to
their computational simulation, to a common algebraic coupling
paradigm. Mathematical analysis of multiphysics coupling in this form
is not always practical for realistic applications, but model problems
representative of applications discussed herein can provide insight.
A variety of software frameworks for multiphysics applications have
been constructed and refined within disciplinary communities and
executed on leading-edge computer systems.  We examine several of
these, expose some commonalities among them, and attempt to
extrapolate best practices to future systems. From our study, we
summarize challenges and forecast opportunities.}

  abstract = {Conventional high-order finite element methods are rarely used for industrial problems because the Jacobian rapidly loses sparsity as the order is increased, leading to unaffordable solve times and memory requirements. This effect typically limits order to at most quadratic, despite the favorable accuracy and stability properties offered by quadratic and higher order discretizations. We present a method in which the action of the Jacobian is applied matrix-free exploiting a tensor product basis on hexahedral elements, while much sparser matrices based on Q 1 sub-elements on the nodes of the high-order basis are assembled for preconditioning. With this  dual-order  scheme, storage is independent of spectral order and a natural taping scheme is available to update a full-accuracy matrix-free Jacobian during residual evaluation. Matrix-free Jacobian application circumvents the memory bandwidth bottleneck typical of sparse matrix operations, providing several times greater floating point performance and better use of multiple cores with shared memory bus. Computational results for the p-Laplacian and Stokes problem, using block preconditioners and AMG, demonstrate mesh-independent convergence rates and weak (bounded) dependence on order, even for highly deformed meshes and nonlinear systems with several orders of magnitude dynamic range in coefficients. For spectral orders around 5, the dual-order scheme requires half the memory and similar time to assembled quadratic (Q 2) elements, making it very affordable for general use.},

  title = {Scalable Nonlinear Compact Schemes},
  number = {ANL/MCS-TM-340},
  institution={Argonne National Laboratory},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Solutions to hyperbolic conservation laws are often characterized by a large range of length scales as well as discontinuities. Standard nonlinear finite-difference schemes, such as the WENO schemes, yield non- oscillatory solutions but lack the spectral resolution required to model the relevant length scales. Linear compact schemes have a high spectral resolution; however, they suffer from spurious oscillations across discontinuities and sharp gradients. Weighted nonlinear compact schemes, such as the CRWENO scheme and the hybrid compact-WENO schemes, combine the non-oscillatory nature of the WENO schemes with the high spectral resolution of the compact schemes and are thus ideal for solutions with multiple length scales and discontinuities. One example of an application area is compressible, turbulent flows. The CRWENO scheme and the hybrid compact-WENO schemes have a nonlinear, solution-dependent left-hand side and therefore require the solution of banded systems of equations at each time-integration step or stage. Application of these schemes to multiprocessor simulations requires an efficient, scalable algorithm for the solution to the banded systems. Past efforts at implementing nonlinear compact schemes for parallel simulations suffer from one or more of the following drawbacks: parallelization-induced approximations and errors, complicated and inefficient scheduling of communication and computation, significant increase in the mathematical complexity of the banded systems solver, and high communication overhead. Therefore, these algorithms do not scale well for massively parallel simulations and are inefficient compared with the corresponding standard finite-difference schemes.},
